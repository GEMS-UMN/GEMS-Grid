    #   ([RRR, R, ... R] * [level[0]['x_length], ... level[6]['x_length]]).sum()
    #   ([CCC, C, ... C] * [level[0]['y_length],... level[6]['y_length]]).sum()
    #   will give the coordinates to the edge of the pixel. For example:
    #
    #   [L6.202482.13.21.00.00.00.00] would decompose into
    #     x = [482, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    #     y = [202, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    #
    #   To determining the coordinate of the left, top edges at Level 2
    #     x = 482 * level[0]['x_length] + 3 * [level[1]['x_length] + 2 * [level[`2`]['x_length]
    #     y = 202 * [level[0]['x_length] + 1 * [level[1]['x_length] + 1 * [level[2]['x_length]
    #
    #   and to determin if it is an edge at level 2, all the remaining Level components must be
    #       zero: [ 0, 0, 0, 0]] summing them all ensure that they are zero
    #
    #   if we asked for the Level 1 coordinate, it would be different. x|y coord is calculated
    #   using the L0, L1 compoents:
    #   x = 482 * level[0]['x_length] + 3 * [level[1]['x_length] + 2

    #       zeros:
    #       [2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    #   since it is not a Level 1 edge, if we needed a right, bottom value, we'd have to shfit
    #       the last L1 index up by one

    # beyond level 0, the row | column index is grid location within the L0 pixes
