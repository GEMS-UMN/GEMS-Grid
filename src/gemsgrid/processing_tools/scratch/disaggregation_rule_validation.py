def range_overlap(range1, range2):

    Test if two ranges overlap.

    Parameters
    ----------
    range1: numpy.ndarray with two values representing a range of a rule
    range2: numpy.ndarray with two values representing a range of a rule

    Returns
    -------
    Nothing, can print or raise a warning if ranges overlap

def not_eq_split(splits, dif):
    '''
    Takes a list of at least 3 values where the smallest and largest values are <, >, <=, or >= rules. The rules

    Parameters
    ----------
    splits: List. A list of at least 3 values forming rules.
    dif: Float. A small value, typically around 0.00001, used to create rules on either side of a != rule. For example,
        the rules <=4, !=7, <=9 becomes [4 to 6.99999] [7.00001 to 9]

    List. A list of numpy nd.arrrays representing ranges of rules.

def parse_rule(rule):
    '''
    Takes the value for a single key of a dictionary that defines mask rules and converts it into a list of ranges
    representing the values effected by a rule. Because we are only interested in if more than one rule applies to
    the same value, we can ignore boolean operators and evaluate each rule independently. All <, >, <=, and >= based
    rules and appended together, sorted, and then paired together, so the order of rules does not matter. If there
    are an unequal number of >/>= and </<= rules, this implies that and unbounded range rule was created, so a max or
    min value for the 32-bit float data type to add a bound.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rule: String. Must match pattern of: (mask{equality operator}{float or int rule value})
