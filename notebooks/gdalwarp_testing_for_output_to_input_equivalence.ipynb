    "# getting data onto GEMS grid\n",
    "\n",
    "this notebook exists to document the exploration of methods for getting data onto the GEMS grid. Focus here is predominanatly on getting raster data to the GEMS grid. Following Jensen (2005) there are two basic models for converting rasters:\n",
    "  1. Input-to-Out Model: In this model, the transformation are done in the forward direction. All coordinates in the source cooridnate system are transformed to the target system, and then the target raster is created using those points and data. This can be thought of as a 'push' or 'put' type model. The challenge with this model is how to deal with the fact that once coordinates are converted to target, they may not align  with target cells (e.g. raster index 5, 2 maps to a cell boundary in the output)\n",
    "  2. Output-to-input model: In this model, the transformations are done in the reverse direction. Dimensions of the output are created, and essentially the mapping is backwards. Coordinates in the output raster are used to identify cooresponding coordinates in the input raster. Often combined with 'nearest neighbor' operations. This can be thought of as a 'pull' or 'get' type of model. The disadvanted here has generally been that that output grid must be known or created in advance. \n",
    "  \n",
    "Many of the tools (e.g. GDAL, ESRI projection toolkit) generally operate in the forward model. Input images and metadata are used with analyst input to create the target raster, and data are pushed through the process in the forward direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Options like ESRI's 'snap to raster' give the ability to ensure that output grids are all consistent, thereby enabling stacking of grids etc. Mechanism there is unclear, but results are akin to the `output-to-input` model above. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, the aim is to investigate standard open source tools (gdal mainly) to see how we might generate output rasters using a process that is more similar to the `output-to-input` model. A challenge with these tools is that grids are almost always tansformed using an affine model, from the upper left corner of the input, with output image dimensiond derived from analyst input. The result is often an output raster that  imperfectly aligns with the GEMS grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the current process that generated the GEMS grid version of the Sacks crop calendar. The input is global in extent, and cutting the inputs down to match the GEMS grid extent introduces challenges. Either the image dimensions don't match (e.g. are more rows/columns in output raster than allowable) or the corners or centroids don't align perfectly. For example, the current Sacks tifs have these properties:\n",
